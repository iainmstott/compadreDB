I have used the Time Tree of Life for making trees too (http://www.timetree.org).  I used this for the book chapter we wrote for the senescence book. It seems very good for the kind of uses we need.

To quote the method from the book chapter:
Our phylogenetically-informed analysis was founded on a phylogeny created by combining the plant tree provided in Salguero-Gómez et al. (2014) and an animal tree based on the trees provided as part of the supplementary material for Hedges et al. (2015) – the “time tree of life” (TTOL). For the animal tree, where the exact species for which we had an MPM was not included in the TTOL, a close relative was selected (e.g. from the same genus). Where we had more than one MPM for a given species we added arbitrary very short branch(es) to represent the 2+ populations. Then, because the trees have been constructed using different methods, rather than using the node heights provided in the dated phylogenies we elected to use Grafen’s (1989) branch length transformation which we implemented using the function compute.brlen in package ape (Paradis et al. 2004), whereby each node is given a ‘height’, matching the number of leaves in the subtree minus one, and these heights are then scaled so that root height is 1.
